NOTE: We recommend the use of FastCraft by Player, a mod that provides increased performance.  It is available through a GUI when you first launch the game. Any bug reports made to Mod Authors while using it must state if you are using it.

Welcome to the second iteration of TestPackPleaseIgnore, a mod pack that's designed and configured to have better balance between the variety of mods included.  This, along with a varied modlist, allows for longer lived worlds than the norms for modded minecraft.  Remember: You can report all bugs on our GitHub repo.
